## Incomplete Roguelike Tutorial using C++14 and libtcod 1.18.1

This series is another heavily inspired by Jotaf's original "Complete roguelike tutorial using python + libtcod"

Over the years, as libtcod has changed, not to mention the C++ language matured, existinc C++ tutorials have fallen behind in getting beginners up & running using libtcod to create a simple roguelike game. This series will specifically cover the use of Visual Studio on Windows.

### Prerequisities

**Installing Visual Studio**



**Installing libtcod**



**Installing SDL2**



### Setting up the project




### First program

We'll create a simple program using libtcod, to ensure that it will compile and display correctly. First, let's create a Source Files/main.cpp file:

**main.cpp**

```
#include <libtcod.hpp>

int main() {
 
 
 
  return 0;
}
```
